    logging: file rolling, NDC / MDC
    finalise service-level unit tests
    improve error handling in DataMappingUtil
    improve markup (form labels, accessibility)
    @Transaction vs unit tests

nice to have
    proper templating with thymeleaf
        include user related headers (logout etc) http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.2.2.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#jc-logout
